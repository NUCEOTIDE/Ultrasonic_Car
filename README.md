# Ultrasonic_Car
A small project for self-improvements about C++ programming and Arduino

Design aim:

Daily update log:

	Day 1 (2018.6.24):
		Publishments:
		1. construct basic code structure.
		2. Done writing basic head files for motor and servo
		To be solve:
		1. clear code plan
		2. hardware update
		
	Day 2 (2018.6.25):
